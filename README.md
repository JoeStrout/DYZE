# Dr. Yond's Zombie Experiment
## a game for [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro)

This is the source code to _Dr. Yond's Zombie Experiment_, a game I created over the course of a few days for a game jam.  The restriction of the game jam was that it could use only the mouse for control — no keyboard, no gamepads, no buttons.

So I made a game in which you play a giant floating brain (Dr. Yond), and zombies follow you wherever you go.  In this manner you can guide the zombies to attack humans or avoid hazards, but it's tricky because you're guiding a lot of zombies at once, and they're not too bright.

The game is written in [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org), and runs in [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro).  To try it out:

1. Download [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro) for your own computer system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
2. Unpack and launch it (you might need to right-click it and choose "Open" to get past the security warning, as the exe is not code-signed).
3. Click the upper of the two disk slots that appear below the screen, and choose "Mount Folder".
4. Mount the _user_ folder you downloaded from this repo.
5. Relaunch Mini Micro (or with version 1.1 or later, enter the `reboot` command).

That should do it!  If you have any questions, want to learn how to make your own Mini Micro games, etc., join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7s6zajx) and say hello.  We'd love to chat with you.
